                    <h1>Who I am.</h1>
                    <p>I was born in Varna(Bulgaria) in 1989 and since then I have lived here. I have been working as
                        driver for 8 years at "Transtiumf AD". Although I do not have any difficulties whit the job,
                        have decided to take step toward something that I would be more keen on. </p>
                    <p>And since I started studying Web Development in Softuni one and a half year ago, I have
                        discovered that I am fond of programming and so I am eagerly looking for a web developer internship,
                        because I am already sure that is what I am going to do throughout my life . </p>

                        <h5>I thought it would be easy. It wasn`t at all!</h5>
                        <p>My education started on October 2018 in Softuni. My first course was "Programming Basics
                            with C#". I passed it successfully, and I continued with "Technology Fundamentals with C#".
                            I
                            was very excited when I took the final exam more than exellent , and then it lit the
                            spark to my willingness toward codding. In order to improve my skill, I have enrolled for
                            "JS
                            Core" there I have became familiar with fuctions, matrices , objects, Maps, JSON, Regex,
                            AJAX, Unit testing, asynchronous programming. I did hundreds of exercises, and in the last
                            exam we had to build SPA with Handlebars. The following courses were Node JS, Express,
                            MongoDb,
                            mongoose, React, Angular, HTML and CSS. Here is the link to my certificates

                                        programming and I built a small blog-project with ms-sql.Now I am just about
                                        finishing my education and getting my diploma with degree more than 5,50.
