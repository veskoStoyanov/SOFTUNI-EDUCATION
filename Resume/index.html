                <h1>Who I am.</h1>
                <p>I was born in Varna(Bulgaria) in 1989 and I have lived here so far. I have been working as
                    driver for 8 years now. Although I do not have any difficulties whit the job,
                    I have decided to take a step toward something I would be more keen on. </p>
                <p>And since I have started studying Web Development at Softuni one and a half year ago, I have
                    discovered I am fond of programming and so I am eagerly looking for a web developer internship,
                    because I am already sure that is what I am going to do throughout my life . </p>

                    <h5>I thought it would be easy. It wasn`t at all!</h5>
                    <p>My education started on October 2018 at Softuni. My first course was "Programming Basics
                        with C#". I passed it successfully, and I continued with "Technology Fundamentals with C#".
                        I was very excited when I took the final exam more than exellent. </p>
                    <p>It then lit up the spark to my willingness toward programming. In order to improve my skill, I
                        have enrolled for
                        "JS Core" there I have became familiar with fuctions, matrices , objects, Maps, JSON, Regex,
                        AJAX, Unit testing, asynchronous programming.</p>
                    <p>I did hundreds of exercises, and in the last
                        exam we had to build SPA with Handlebars. The following courses were Node JS, Express,
                        MongoDb, mongoose, React, Angular, HTML and CSS. Here is the link to my certificates
                        in my profile in Softuni the button below.</p>

                                <p>During the two courses with C# I was studying troubleshooting with data types and

                                    classes, lambda expression, linq, matrices, queues , stucks, functional
                                    programming and I built a small blog-project with ms-sql.</p>
                                <p>Now I am just about
                                    finishing my education and getting my diploma with degree more than 5,50.
                                    Although for programers studying stops never .</p>

                                <p>I am in the end of the intermediate english course now . I have been studying it
                                    nearly one year and a half. First in "bell education", but due lack of the next
                                    course in short time, I moved in "infobulgaria" and I won't stop until I am

                                <p>My motto witch I repeat myself every day is: work hard and do
                                    not waste your precious time. Use any single minute to improve yourself.
                                    Everything in you life depends on you.
